### Formatting Strings Cheat Sheet
## String Reference Cheat Sheet

In Python, there are a lot of things you can do with strings. In this cheat sheet, youâ€™ll find the most common string operations and string methods.
String operations

    **len(string)** - Returns the length of the string

    **for character in string** - Iterates over each character in the string

    **if substring in string** - Checks whether the substring is part of the string

    **string[i]** - Accesses the character at index i of the string, starting at zero

    **string[i:j]** - Accesses the substring starting at index i, ending at index j minus 1. If i is omitted, its value defaults to 0. If j is omitted, the value will default to len(string).

String methods

    **string.lower()** - Returns a copy of the string with all lowercase characters

    **string.upper()** - Returns a copy of the string with all uppercase characters

    **string.lstrip()** - Returns a copy of the string with the left-side whitespace removed

    **string.rstrip()** - Returns a copy of the string with the right-side whitespace removed

    **string.strip()** - Returns a copy of the string with both the left and right-side whitespace removed

    **string.count(substring)** - Returns the number of times substring is present in the string

    **string.isnumeric()** - Returns True if there are only numeric characters in the string. If not, returns False.

    **string.isalpha()** - Returns True if there are only alphabetic characters in the string. If not, returns False.

    **string.split()** - Returns a list of substrings that were separated by whitespace (whitespace can be a space, tab, or new line)

    **string.split(delimiter)** - Returns a list of substrings that were separated by whitespace or a delimiter

    **string.replace(old, new)** - Returns a new string where all occurrences of old have been replaced by new.

    **delimiter.join(list of strings)** - Returns a new string with all the strings joined by the delimiter 
    
    
# Lists and Tuples Operations Cheat Sheet

##### Lists and tuples are both sequences, so they share a number of sequence operations. But, because lists are mutable, there are also a number of methods specific just to lists. This cheat sheet gives you a run down of the common operations first, and the list-specific operations second.
##### Common sequence operations

    len(sequence) - Returns the length of the sequence

    for element in sequence - Iterates over each element in the sequence

    if element in sequence - Checks whether the element is part of the sequence

    sequence[i] - Accesses the element at index i of the sequence, starting at zero

    sequence[i:j] - Accesses a slice starting at index i, ending at index j-1. If i is omitted, it's 0 by default. If j is omitted, it's len(sequence) by default.

    for index, element in enumerate(sequence) - Iterates over both the indexes and the elements in the sequence at the same time

##### Check out the official documentation for sequence operations.
##### List-specific operations and methods

    list[i] = x - Replaces the element at index i with x

    list.append(x) - Inserts x at the end of the list

    list.insert(i, x) - Inserts x at index i

    list.pop(i) - Returns the element a index i, also removing it from the list. If i is omitted, the last element is returned and removed.

    list.remove(x) - Removes the first occurrence of x in the list

    list.sort() - Sorts the items in the list

    list.reverse() - Reverses the order of items of the list

    list.clear() - Removes all the items of the list

    list.copy() - Creates a copy of the list

    list.extend(other_list) - Appends all the elements of other_list at the end of list

##### Most of these methods come from the fact that lists are mutable sequences. For more info, see the official documentation for mutable sequences and the list specific documentation.
##### List comprehension

    [expression for variable in sequence] - Creates a new list based on the given sequence. Each element is the result of the given expression.

    [expression for variable in sequence if condition] - Creates a new list based on the given sequence. Each element is the result of the given expression; elements only get added if the condition is true.
